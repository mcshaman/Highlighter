# Highlighter

InDesign users have often had to use hacks, such as oversized underlines and paragraph rules to achieve this seemingly simple effect. With Highlighter you can create funky, highly customisable highlighter effects quickly, easily and without
having to create new or hack existing styles.

## Instructions

1. Run script and choose the paragraph styles you would like to highlight. To select more than one, CMD + click for Mac or CTL + click for Windows.
2. Use the highlight offset controls to week positioning and size of the highlight.
3. Select a target layer for the highlights to be applied to.
4. Select a object style to apply to each highlight.
5. Hit OK! 

By customising the object style you can create some funky effects.
